"""Pre-write duplicate detection for named entities (ARCH-030).

The August 2026 QA sweep found the repository 46% duplicated at 145 ArchiMate
elements — 25 duplicate-name groups covering 67 rows, many triplicated — plus
four near-identical Solutions and an ``/applications/create`` endpoint that
returned ``201 Created`` three times in a row for a byte-identical name. There
was no duplicate check anywhere on the write path, and the AI agent creates
entities autonomously, so the duplication accrues at machine speed.

This module supplies the check. It is deliberately *application*-level rather
than a database ``UNIQUE`` constraint:

* ``flask reconcile-schema`` is ADD-COLUMN-only and cannot add a constraint, and
  deploys do not run ``flask db upgrade`` (see CLAUDE.md, "Schema management").
* 67 duplicate rows already exist in production, so a unique index would fail to
  build against the live data.

Tenancy
-------
Models inheriting ``TenantMixin`` already get ``WHERE organization_id =
g.current_org_id`` injected by ``do_orm_execute``, so the queries here add **no**
organization predicate for them — doing so would double-filter. For models that
are tenant-owned but not mixed in, pass ``organization_id=`` explicitly. For
genuinely global reference data (``VendorOrganization``) pass nothing.

    ``find_duplicate_by_name`` is a check, and a check followed by an insert is
    a TOCTOU race. Verified on ``POST /applications/create``: sequential repeats
    correctly redirected to the first row, but five *simultaneous* identical
    posts created five rows and four created three — a double-clicked Save
    duplicating an application in a system of record.

    Why a lock and not a UNIQUE index. A unique index is the stronger
    guarantee and would be the first choice on a greenfield schema, but this
    schema cannot get one safely: ``flask reconcile-schema`` is ADD-COLUMN-only
    and deploys do not run ``flask db upgrade`` (CLAUDE.md, "Schema
    management"), so the index would have to be created out of band; and it
    would fail to build wherever duplicate rows already exist — which they do,
    and which the product deliberately permits via ``allow_duplicate``. An
    index cannot express "unique unless the caller opted in", so adopting one
    would silently delete that feature. A transaction-scoped advisory lock
    closes the race without a schema change, without a build that can fail on
    live data, and without removing the opt-out.

    Taken immediately BEFORE the duplicate check and held to the end of the
    transaction by Postgres, so the whole check-then-insert is serialised per
    (table, tenant, folded name). It blocks only writers of the identical name;
    unrelated creates are unaffected.

    Returns True when the lock was taken, False when the backend does not
    support advisory locks (non-PostgreSQL). Never raises: failing to lock must
    not turn a working create into a 500 — it degrades to the pre-existing
    application-level check.
