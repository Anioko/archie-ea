"""Validate a user-supplied ``next`` URL before redirecting to it.

The login views accepted any value that did not start with ``//`` and did not
contain ``://``. That looks sufficient and is not: browsers normalise a
backslash to a forward slash in the authority position, so ``/\\evil.com``
passes both tests and Chrome and Firefox then navigate to ``//evil.com``.

That turns a post-authentication redirect into a credential-phishing chain: the
victim signs in to the real site and lands on the attacker's copy, having just
been trained that the flow is legitimate.

Validation here is allow-list shaped - the value must parse as a site-relative
path - rather than a list of the tricks known today.
