# organization_id is carried through from the owning solution because this command
# runs with no request context: the before_flush listener in
# app/middleware/tenant_isolation.py only stamps organization_id when
# g.current_org_id is set, so a CLI-created ArchiMateElement would otherwise be
# written with a NULL organization_id and be invisible to every tenant's ORM
# queries afterwards. The three formerly solution_id-only queries now join
