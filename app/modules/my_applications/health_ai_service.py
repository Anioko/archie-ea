"""AI health assessment for the Application Manager persona.

An application manager can see health/lifecycle status today but has no
help deciding what those values should be. This service assembles a
strictly-real context (the owned application's own fields, its primary
vendor product and that product's lifecycle) and asks the LLM for a
structured health assessment: a summary, suggested health/lifecycle
status, the signals behind them, recommended actions, and a rationale.

Advisory only. Nothing here is written back to the application — the
caller (app/modules/my_applications/health_ai_routes.py) must not persist
any part of the response. A suggestion only reaches the record if the
owner follows the "Apply suggestion" link into the existing edit form and
saves it themselves.
