"""AI health assessment endpoint for the Application Manager persona.

Registered onto my_applications_bp via a side-effect import in
app/modules/my_applications/__init__.py, matching the routes.py /
crud_routes.py pattern already used by this module.

Purely advisory: it returns a suggested health/lifecycle assessment and
writes nothing to the application. Applying a suggestion still goes through
the existing GET/POST /my-applications/app/<id>/edit flow, which the owner
must review and submit themselves.
