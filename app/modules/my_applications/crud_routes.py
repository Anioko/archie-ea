"""Write path for the Application Manager persona.

Until 2026-07-31 this module exposed five routes, all GET. An application manager
could look at the applications they were accountable for and change nothing about
them - not the lifecycle status, not the health assessment, not the named
technical lead. The persona is defined by ownership of a record it could only
read.

Scoping here is by ownership, not just tenancy. Being in the right organisation
is not sufficient: the whole point of the persona is that it manages the subset
of applications it owns, so every handler confirms an ApplicationOwner row links
the current user to the application before writing.

That check has to be explicit. ApplicationOwner carries organization_id but not
TenantMixin, so nothing filters it, and Solution.query.get() would happily return
an application this user has no relationship to at all.
