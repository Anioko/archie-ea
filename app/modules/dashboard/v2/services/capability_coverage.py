"""Single source of truth for "capability coverage %" across dashboard surfaces.

4 Sep 2026: the CTO-tab hero health-score panel (`dashboard_views.py::overview`)
and the lazy-loaded Executive Summary fragment
(`ExecutiveDashboardService._get_capability_coverage`) both labelled a number
"Capability Coverage %" and fed it into an identically-weighted "Health Score"
composite (40% phase maturity / 30% risk / 20% capability coverage / 10%
governance) — but computed it from two different tables: the hero counted L1
capabilities with >=1 mapped ApplicationCapabilityMapping row, the fragment
counted capabilities with >=1 mapped SolutionCapabilityMapping row (a much
sparser relationship). Same label, same weight, same page, genuinely different
number (100% vs 0%, observed live) — an ADR-0008 violation for a computed
metric rather than a stored table. This module is the fix: one query, two
callers.
