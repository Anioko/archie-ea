Generate elements across ALL SEVEN ArchiMate layers for this capability:

MOTIVATION LAYER (6-10 elements — HARD CAP: max 10, aim for 6-8):
IMPORTANT: Do NOT repeat Stakeholder, Driver, or Goal elements that also appear in other
capabilities — generate each motivation element once across the full solution.
- Stakeholder: every person/team/org with interest (business owner, end users, ops, security, compliance)
- Driver: business and technical pressures (cost reduction, regulation, efficiency, risk)
- Goal: measurable outcomes tied to each driver (KPIs, SLAs)
- Requirement: EVERY non-functional requirement across these categories:
  * Performance (latency, throughput, concurrency targets)
  * Security (authentication, authorization, encryption, audit trail)
  * Availability (uptime SLA, DR/BC, failover, RTO/RPO)
  * Scalability (horizontal/vertical scaling, elasticity)
  * Data (retention, classification, sovereignty, PII handling)
  * Integration (protocols, formats, SLAs for external systems)
  * Compliance (regulatory: GDPR, SOX, ISO 27001, industry-specific)
  * Usability (accessibility WCAG, i18n, responsive design)
- Constraint: any limits (budget, timeline, legacy compatibility, regulatory)
- Principle: architectural principles this capability must follow

STRATEGY LAYER (3-6 elements):
- Capability: the business capability itself + any sub-capabilities (L1→L2 decomposition)
- CourseOfAction: strategic approach to deliver this capability (build vs buy, phased rollout)
- ValueStream: end-to-end value delivery this capability participates in. MUST be linked in relationships: one Goal REALIZES this ValueStream (the stream is the mechanism by which the goal becomes real); this ValueStream ASSOCIATED-WITH the Capability it depends on; this ValueStream REALIZES one Outcome (the measurable result of execution).
- Resource: key resources needed (people, budget, expertise)

BUSINESS LAYER (8-15 elements):
- BusinessProcess: every process this capability supports (including sub-processes)
- BusinessService: services exposed to users/other capabilities
- BusinessObject: business data entities (e.g., "Customer Record", "Invoice", "Contract")
- BusinessRole: roles that interact with these processes
- BusinessActor: specific organizational units or external parties
- BusinessEvent: triggers and business events
- Contract: SLAs or agreements with external parties

APPLICATION LAYER (8-15 elements):
- ApplicationComponent: software modules (main app + sub-components/microservices)
- ApplicationService: services exposed by each component
- ApplicationInterface: APIs (REST, GraphQL, messaging), UIs, integration points
- ApplicationFunction: internal behaviors (processing, calculation, transformation)
- DataObject: EVERY data entity (10+ minimum — entities, documents, messages, configs, audit logs, cache objects)
  Include data_classification (public/internal/confidential/restricted) and contains_pii (true/false) for each

TECHNOLOGY LAYER (6-12 elements):
- Node: servers, VMs, containers, Kubernetes clusters, load balancers
- SystemSoftware: OS, databases, message brokers, monitoring, security tools, middleware
- TechnologyService: cloud services (compute, storage, networking, managed services)
- CommunicationNetwork: networks, VPNs, CDNs, service mesh
- Artifact: deployment packages, configuration files, container images
- Device: end-user devices if applicable

IMPLEMENTATION LAYER (3-6 elements):
- WorkPackage: implementation phases/projects for this capability
- Plateau: architecture states (Baseline → Transition → Target)
- Gap: specific gaps between current and target state
- Deliverable: key outputs (documentation, deployed service, migrated data)

Rules:
- Each element MUST have: type, name, description, source ("existing" or "derived")
- Names must be SPECIFIC to this solution (e.g., "Fraud Detection API Gateway" not "API Gateway")
- BANNED GENERIC NAMES — never use: "API Gateway", "Frontend Application", "Backend Service",
  "Core Business Entity", "Integration Service", "Data Store", "Business Component". Every name
  must include the solution domain (e.g., "Stripe Payment API Gateway", not "API Gateway").
- For DataObjects: ALWAYS include data_classification and contains_pii
- Generate at LEAST 40 elements total across all layers
- Implementation layer is MANDATORY — always generate at least 1 WorkPackage + 1 Plateau
- Every element must be relevant to the capability being expanded

For EACH capability, generate elements across ALL SIX ArchiMate layers.
Tag every element with "capability_source" set to the EXACT capability name from the list above.

Per capability, generate at LEAST 14 elements total:

APPLICATION LAYER (3-4 per capability) — GENERATE FIRST:
- ApplicationComponent, ApplicationService, ApplicationInterface, ApplicationFunction
- DataObject: include data_classification (public/internal/confidential/restricted) and contains_pii (true/false)

TECHNOLOGY LAYER (2-3 per capability) — use SPECIFIC infrastructure names, NOT mirrors of ApplicationComponents:
TYPE RATIO RULE: For every 3 technology elements, aim for 1 Node + 1 SystemSoftware + 1 TechnologyService.
If generating 2 elements: 1 Node + 1 SystemSoftware (TechnologyService is optional).
TechnologyService MUST NOT exceed 40% of your technology elements.
- Node (MINIMUM 1 per capability): actual compute nodes — e.g., "GCP Cloud Run Instance", "AWS ECS Fargate Cluster", "On-Premise Application Server". NOT "Node: Email Service". NOT just a mirror of an ApplicationComponent name.
- SystemSoftware (MINIMUM 1 per capability): actual software platforms — e.g., "PostgreSQL 15 Database", "RabbitMQ Message Broker", "nginx Reverse Proxy". NOT "SystemSoftware: AI Order Processing Engine".
- TechnologyService: ONLY for cloud-managed services — e.g., "GCP Cloud Storage Bucket", "Azure Service Bus". NEVER name a TechnologyService the same as an ApplicationComponent.
- CommunicationNetwork, Artifact: as needed

BUSINESS LAYER (2-3 per capability):
- BusinessProcess, BusinessService, BusinessObject, BusinessRole, BusinessActor

MOTIVATION LAYER (EXACTLY 5 per capability — HARD CAP, never exceed 5):
CROSS-CAPABILITY DEDUP RULE: If the same Requirement, Goal, or Stakeholder applies to multiple
capabilities, generate it ONCE under the most relevant capability only. Do NOT repeat it.
- Requirement (MINIMUM 2, MANDATORY — generate before all other motivation elements):
  Name each as a specific verifiable condition, NOT an echo of a Goal name.
  Cover at least 2 of these categories per capability:
  * Performance: "<component> must process <metric> within <threshold>" (e.g., "Email parsing latency < 500ms p95")
  * Security/Compliance: "<data or system> must comply with <standard>" (e.g., "Personal data must comply with GDPR Article 17")
  * Availability: "<service> uptime must be >= <SLA>" (e.g., "Order processing service uptime >= 99.9%")
  * Data: "<data type> must be classified as <level> with PII handling per <policy>"
  * Integration: "<system A> must integrate with <system B> via <protocol> within <latency>"
  WRONG: "Requirement: Reduce manual order processing workload" (that is the Goal, not a Requirement)
  RIGHT: "Requirement: Order extraction accuracy >= 98% with < 2% false-positive rate"
- Goal (1): measurable outcome this capability delivers
- Driver (1): business or technical pressure driving this capability
- Constraint (1): hard limit (budget, timeline, technology, regulatory)
IMPORTANT: The 5-element cap is STRICT. Do not add extra Stakeholder, Assessment, Value, or Meaning
elements on top — they push motivation past the cap and cause layer imbalance.

STRATEGY LAYER (1-2 per capability):
- Capability, CourseOfAction, ValueStream, Resource

Rules:
- Names must be SPECIFIC to this solution (e.g., "Fraud Detection API Gateway" not "API Gateway")
- BANNED GENERIC NAMES — these provide zero information and must never appear:
  "API Gateway", "Frontend Application", "Backend Service", "Core Business Entity",
  "Integration Service", "Data Store", "Business Component", "Application Service",
  "Technology Service", "Business Process". Every name must include the solution domain.
- Every element MUST have: type, name, description, source ("existing" or "derived"), capability_source
- Use "existing" source and exact name only for apps listed in EXISTING APPLICATIONS above
- Avoid duplicate element names across capabilities (merge shared infrastructure elements)
- IMPLEMENTATION LAYER IS MANDATORY: Always generate at least 1 WorkPackage and 1 Plateau
  for the solution, even if only one capability is present. Do NOT omit this layer.
- Outcome and Assessment elements MUST describe specific measurable results, NOT echo other element names
  WRONG: {{"type": "Outcome", "name": "Outcome: Reduce manual order processing workload"}}
  RIGHT: {{"type": "Outcome", "name": "20% reduction in order processing headcount within 6 months"}}

ALL ELEMENTS (by layer):
{elements_summary}

Generate relationships using these ArchiMate 3.2 types:
- Realization: ApplicationService realizes BusinessProcess; CourseOfAction realizes Capability; Goal realizes ValueStream; ValueStream realizes Outcome
- Serving: ApplicationComponent serves BusinessService; TechnologyService serves ApplicationComponent; Capability serves ValueStream
- Composition: ApplicationComponent composed-of DataObject; Node composed-of SystemSoftware
- Aggregation: BusinessFunction aggregates BusinessProcess
- Assignment: Node assigned-to ApplicationComponent; BusinessRole assigned-to BusinessProcess
- Association: Requirement associated-with Goal; Stakeholder associated-with Driver; ValueStream associated-with Capability
- Influence: Driver influences Goal; Assessment influences Requirement
- Flow: ApplicationInterface flow-to ApplicationInterface (data exchange)
- Access: ApplicationService accesses DataObject (read/write)
- Triggering: BusinessEvent triggers BusinessProcess; ValueStream stage triggers next ValueStream stage

MANDATORY CHAINS — every generated architecture MUST include these:
1. Strategy chain: Goal -[realization]-> ValueStream -[association]-> Capability -[realization]-> BusinessProcess
2. Outcome chain: ValueStream -[realization]-> Outcome (the measurable result of executing the stream)
3. Vertical chain: Goal -[realization]-> ValueStream; Capability -[realization]-> BusinessProcess -[realization]-> ApplicationService -[serving]-> ApplicationComponent -[realization]-> Node
4. Technical chain: ApplicationComponent -[realization]-> Node -[composition]-> SystemSoftware (each app has infrastructure)
5. Coverage chain: ApplicationComponent -[serving]-> BusinessService -[realization]-> BusinessProcess (app layer serves business)

RULES:
- Generate at LEAST 3 relationships per element (aim for {target_rel_count} total)
- EVERY element must connect to at least one other element — no islands
- Cross-layer relationships are critical: connect Motivation→Strategy→Business→Application→Technology
- The full canonical chain: Goal→ValueStream→Capability→BusinessProcess→ApplicationService→ApplicationComponent→Node
