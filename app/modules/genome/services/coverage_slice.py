"""Business-layer genome slice: Capability -> Application coverage.

A minimal, DETERMINISTIC, zero-LLM genome slice builder. It reads directly
from the populated business-layer stores for ONE organization:

    business_capability            (BusinessCapability, TenantMixin)
    application_components         (ApplicationComponent, TenantMixin)
    application_capability_mapping (ApplicationCapabilityMapping)

and each store's `archimate_element_id` link, and assembles a validated dict:

    {
      "slice_version": "1.0.0",
      "organization_id": int,
      "capability_source": "business_capability",   # ADR 0008: named, single store
      "capabilities": [ {id, name, code, archimate_element_id}, ... ],
      "applications":  [ {id, name, archimate_element_id}, ... ],
      "cells": [ {capability_id, application_id, mapping,
                  provenance: {capability_archimate_element_id,
                               application_archimate_element_id}}, ... ],
      "spec_hash": "sha256:...",
    }

This is NOT the 2990-line compile_genome. It is the demo-scoped business-layer
slice described in genome_rearch/01_blueprint.md section 4.

Provenance is STRUCTURAL and NON-OPTIONAL: a cell whose capability or
application does not resolve to a real ArchiMateElement id is a build error
(SliceProvenanceError), never a silent gap. This mirrors genome_to_bundle's
`archimate_source_id` pattern — the id is threaded from the source row, never
inferred and never asked of an LLM.
