"""Blueprint Completeness Service — per-section scoring engine.

Scores each of the 14 blueprint sections based on:
  - Element coverage (40%): required ArchiMate element types present with descriptions
  - Relationship coverage (35%): downstream chain completeness via InferenceEngine
  - Traceability (25%): chain validation errors via InferenceEngine

For spec-enabled sections (application_cooperation, data_information, deployment_view),
two additional dimensions are scored:
  - Spec completeness (20%): all specs confirmed (fields, contracts, rules, deployment)
  - Spec quality (20%): validated, versioned, hashed, described

Gracefully degrades when no architecture model or elements are linked.

# Canonical blueprint section catalogue (S-02 / S-03)
#
# This list IS the blueprint document: the template renders one section per
# entry, in this order, and every completeness figure on the page divides by
# `len(BLUEPRINT_SECTIONS)`. Before this list existed, four surfaces each
# carried their own hardcoded copy of the section ids and their own literal
# denominator of 14 — the governance ring, the "N of 14 sections" caption,
# the gap-advisor card and the header strip — so one page load could show
# 25% / 6-of-14 / 13-of-14-need-work / 8-not-started simultaneously, and
# "Architecture Decisions" (section 15, backed and editable) was counted by
# none of them. Add a section here and every surface picks it up; do not
# re-list section ids in a template.
#
# `erp_fit_gap` and `integration_architecture` are scored by the service but
# are NOT part of the blueprint document (no rendered section), so they are
# deliberately absent — a section the reader cannot see must not move a
# number the reader can.
#
# `kind` says how blueprint.html renders it: "narrative" and "matrix" and
# "decisions" are bespoke blocks; "viewpoint" entries are the generic
# diagram+table loop.

def compute_blueprint_completeness(scores):
    """Derive every completeness figure the blueprint page shows, once.

    Weighting model — chosen explicitly, not emergent:
      * All sections carry EQUAL weight. There is no per-section multiplier;
        a missing Executive Summary costs exactly as much as a missing
        Deployment view.
      * `percent` is the arithmetic mean of the per-section `overall` scores,
        so a partially-filled section earns FRACTIONAL credit (a page of
        50%-filled sections reads 50%, not 0%). It is not the ratio of
        complete sections — that ratio is `sections_complete / total_sections`
        and is reported separately rather than conflated with the dial.
      * A section is `complete` at >= 80 (SECTION_COMPLETE_THRESHOLD, the ARB
        gate), `not_started` at exactly 0, and `partial` in between. The three
        buckets are exhaustive and disjoint, so they always sum to
        `total_sections`, and `sections_needing_work` == partial + not_started.
      * A missing score is 0, never omitted — a section with no data is
        incomplete, not excluded from the denominator.
