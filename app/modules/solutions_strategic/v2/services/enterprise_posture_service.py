"""Enterprise posture lenses for the Chief Architect Workbench.

`ChiefArchitectService.portfolio_synthesis` answers "how are the *solutions*
doing?".  A Chief Architect also has to answer "how is the *enterprise* doing?"
— the capability model, the application portfolio, technology standards and
their exceptions, the roadmap, and the decision record.  This module supplies
those lenses.

Three rules govern every number in here, and they are the reason the module
exists rather than reusing an existing "health" service:

1.  **Only directly countable record facts.**  Every measure is a ``COUNT`` over
    a named column of a named model, with its own explicit denominator.  There
    is deliberately no composite score.  Several services in this tree compute a
    "health score" from hardcoded weights (start at 100, subtract ``gap * 15``,
    …); those are heuristics presented as measurements, and consuming one here
    would launder it into the Chief Architect's headline view.  A reader can
    reproduce every number below with a single SQL ``COUNT``.

2.  **A failure is reported, never rounded down to zero.**  Each lens is
    computed inside its own ``try``; on failure the lens goes to
    ``state="unavailable"`` with every value ``None``, which the template renders
    as an em dash.  A ``0`` here would be indistinguishable from a measured zero.

3.  **Missing information is a first-class result.**  ``missing`` counts records
    that exist but do not carry the field, so "we have not modelled this" is
    visible instead of silently shrinking a denominator.

Tenancy: every model read here carries ``TenantMixin``, so the
``do_orm_execute`` filter scopes these counts to ``g.current_org_id`` inside a
request.  Called outside a request context they are unscoped — see AGENTS.md.
