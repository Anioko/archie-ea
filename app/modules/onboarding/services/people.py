"""People (or teams) and what they do, captured at onboarding, written to the real tables.

Nothing here is an onboarding copy:
  * a person or team is a ``BusinessActor`` (``Individual`` / ``Team``); creating one
    already creates its ArchiMate element;
  * "who does which capability" is an ``EnterpriseRaciAssignment`` written through
    ``organization.service.upsert_raci_cell``, the same call the RACI matrix uses;
  * how well they do it is one ``CapabilityProficiency`` row per RACI cell, the only
    new store, because nothing else could hold it.

How people are captured depends on company size. A small company names each
person. A large one rates teams (with a headcount) and can still name the few key
individuals. Onboarding never deletes an actor; it only clears an assignment the
founder explicitly removed.

Proficiency is personal data about a named individual. It is written only when the
founder gives it, and NULL means "not assessed".
