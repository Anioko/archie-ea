"""AI drafting assist for Business Model Canvas blocks.

The 9-box canvas (app/templates/business_model/detail.html) is filled in by
hand, one free-text block at a time. This drafts a single block from the
canvas's *other* already-filled blocks plus cheap app/capability aggregates
— advisory only. The draft is handed to the UI's existing inline textarea/
save-block flow; nothing here is written to the canvas directly.
