"""Single source of truth for default LLM model ids and their prices.

The newest Claude referenced anywhere was Haiku 4.5, so the Anthropic path was
either calling a model that no longer exists or routing enterprise-architecture
reasoning through the cheapest tier in the lineup.

Operators still choose their own model per provider in Admin -> API Settings
(APISettings.default_model); this is only the fallback used when nothing is
configured, and the guidance shown alongside that field.

Keep DEFAULT_MODELS and PRICING_PER_1K in step. A price keyed to a model nobody
runs makes cost reporting fiction - ai_rate_limiter priced claude-3-opus, a model
that has been retired since January 2026.
