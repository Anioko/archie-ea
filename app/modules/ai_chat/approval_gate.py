"""
Approval gate for AI-originated CRUD operations (A95-008).

When REQUIRE_AI_APPROVAL=true, a gated write does NOT execute immediately.
Instead `queue_ai_write()` creates a real, executable AIChatCRUDApproval row
via AIChatApprovalService.create_pending_approval and returns an HTTP 202
response carrying that row's real id. The row appears in
GET /ai-chat/approvals/pending, and POST /ai-chat/approvals/<id>/approve
calls AIChatApprovalService.approve_and_execute, which performs the actual
write through AIDataInteractionService -- the same service method the route
calls directly when the gate is off.

This used to be a bare decorator (`@require_ai_approval`) that returned the
202/pending_approval shape without creating any approval record at all:
nothing appeared in the pending list, there was no approval_id, and the
write was silently dropped forever -- fabricated progress. It is now a
function, `queue_ai_write(operation_type, entity_type, payload, summary,
entity_id=None)`, called *inline* from inside the view body rather than as a
decorator wrapping the whole function. That placement matters: several of
these routes validate and sanitize `request.get_json()` (HTML-escaping,
enum checks, length limits) before handing the result to the
AIDataInteractionService call. A decorator wrapping the entire view sees
only the raw, unvalidated body and would queue *that* -- so approving it
later would run unsanitized input through the same write path the direct
route deliberately protects. Calling queue_ai_write() after validation, with
the already-validated `data` dict as `payload`, means the approval record
(and what approve_and_execute eventually writes) is byte-for-byte what the
route would have written itself.

operation_type/entity_type are not free-form labels: they must be one of
the pairs AIChatApprovalService.approve_and_execute's dispatch actually
executes ("create"/capability|application|vendor|capability_mapping|
work_package, "update"/capability|application|vendor, "link"/
application_capability_mapping, "delete"/capability|application|vendor --
see that file). A write that cannot be expressed in that vocabulary must
not call queue_ai_write() at all -- see the routes in workflow_routes.py
that execute immediately with a comment explaining why (add-compliance-
requirement, create-requirement, apply-archimate, apply-apqc): an honest
immediate write beats queuing something the approval step could never
actually execute.
