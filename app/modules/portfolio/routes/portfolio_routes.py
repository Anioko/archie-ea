"""Portfolio views: the initiative list and the initiative detail.

Every figure here is either read from the database or rendered as an em dash.
Nothing is defaulted to 0 — a spend of zero and a spend nobody recorded are
different facts, and conflating them is what made the rest of this platform's
dashboards untrustworthy (see the fabricated-data gate).

Tenant scoping is implicit: EnterpriseInitiative, Benefit, Demand and Assumption
all carry TenantMixin, so do_orm_execute injects the organisation predicate.
