"""Ask, Twin map and Worked-out connections: the pages of the intelligence
module's user interface.

Every route only renders a page shell. The data is fetched in the browser from
endpoints that already exist: element search from the ArchiMate picker
endpoint, the impact answer and the yield answer from the intelligence API, so
the pages carry no query of their own and no way to read another tenant's rows.

The provenance drawer is not a route. It opens over either page.
