"""Tests for the plain-terms sentence on derived rows (FR-15).

Covers the three confidence bands and their boundaries, the rounding of the
percentage, the omission of the confidence clause when confidence is null, the
absence of a sentence when a name, a depth or a relationship type is missing,
which element is named first and which wording is used for every derived
relationship type, "1 hop" versus "N hops", the sentence as read through
``cross_layer_impact`` from either end of a fact, and the scan that keeps the
sentence's wording in ``plain_terms.py`` alone.
