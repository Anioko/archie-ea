"""T-002 task 01: the scheduled projection job and the maturity accessor.

Uses committed rows (not the ``db_session`` savepoint fixture) because
``execute_projection_with_audit`` opens its own connection via
``db.engine.connect()`` — a savepoint held on a *different* connection would
be invisible to it. Every row created here is committed and explicitly
cleaned up in a ``finally`` block, following the pattern PR #23's own
projection tests use (see the class docstring on ``ProjectionBlocked`` in
``app/commands/project_capabilities.py`` for why the projection cannot run
inside a nested transaction).
