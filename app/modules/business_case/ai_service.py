"""AI drafting assist for Business Case document sections.

The structured business-case document (app/templates/business_case/
detail.html) has five narrative sections a Business Architect fills in by
hand — problem statement, options considered, recommendation, expected
benefits, key risks. This drafts one section at a time from the case's
*other* filled sections plus its own linked capability/initiative/solution
and already-entered financial figures — advisory only. The draft is handed
to the UI's existing inline textarea/save-field flow; nothing here is
written to the case directly.

Financial fields (capex, opex_annual, tco_3yr, roi_percentage,
financial_benefit_annual, payback_months) are numeric inputs backed by
aggregate_financials() (app/modules/business_case/service.py), not
free-text sections, so they are intentionally excluded from what this
service can draft.
