"""AI drafting assist for the value-stream x capability mapping grid.

The BIZBOK grid on a value stream's detail page (app/templates/value_streams/
detail.html, app/modules/capabilities/routes/value_stream_routes.py) is
click-to-set: a user opens a cell and chooses a support level by hand. This
service suggests candidate (stage, capability) pairs from the stream's own
stages and this organization's real capability catalog — advisory only.
Nothing here is written to the database; the UI's "Apply" action reuses the
grid's existing POST /value-streams/api/mapping write path exactly, so the
AI-suggested pairs go through the same validation and persistence as a
manually-set cell.

    UnifiedCapability has no organization_id column at all (it's a shared,

    org's capability names into this org's LLM prompt. Instead this derives
    names from the union of two things this org has actually mapped:

    - CapabilityValueStreamMapping (TenantMixin) — capabilities this org has
      mapped onto a value-stream stage anywhere. do_orm_execute injects the
      organization_id filter directly onto this entity.
    - UnifiedApplicationCapabilityMapping, joined to ApplicationComponent
      (TenantMixin). The mapping table itself carries no organization_id,
      but the join target does, and do_orm_execute's with_loader_criteria
      applies to any TenantMixin entity present in the query — including a
      join target — so this is scoped to this org's applications.

    A failure in one query still lets the other contribute real names, and
    when it does the partial-but-real result set is used — with a warning
    naming which source failed, so the gap is visible in logs even though
    the caller gets a 200. It is only when a query failed *and* the combined
    name set is empty that a CapabilityCatalogUnavailableError is raised:
    with nothing recovered, an empty list is indistinguishable from "this
    org genuinely has no mappings", and that ambiguity is exactly what the
