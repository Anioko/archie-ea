Capability Health Service

Provides health-centric analysis for business capabilities, calculating readiness scores
and identifying hot-spots for architectural investment.

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED VERSION:
- Uses eager loading to prevent N + 1 queries (reduced from 339 queries to ~10)
- Pre-loads parent relationships for domain traversal
- Batches application queries
- Caches compliance scores
- Result-level TTL cache (60s) to avoid redundant recomputation
