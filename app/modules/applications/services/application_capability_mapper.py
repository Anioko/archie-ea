AI-Powered Application-Capability Mapper

Automatically analyzes applications and suggests BusinessCapability mappings

Usage:

    # Analyze single application
    suggestions = service.suggest_capabilities_for_application(app_id)

    # Bulk map all unmapped applications
    result = service.bulk_map_applications(confidence_threshold=0.7)

Identify the TOP {top_n} business capabilities this application supports or enables.

   - 'secondary': App provides backup/supplemental support
   - 'partial': App covers some aspects of the capability
3. Provide clear reasoning
4. Suggest maturity_level (1 - 5): How mature is the app's support for this capability?
