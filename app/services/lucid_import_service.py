"""Load a transformed Lucidchart payload into the ArchiMate repository.

One implementation, two front doors. The CLI (`flask import-lucid`) and the
import screen both call `import_payload`, because an importer that behaves
differently depending on how it was invoked is two importers, and only one of
them ever gets tested.

`preview=True` does every lookup and every comparison and writes nothing. That
is what makes a review screen possible: an architect can see exactly what would
be created, what would attach to something already in the repository, and what
would change, before any of it happens. It is also the honest way to answer
"what will re-importing this diagram do to my estate?".
