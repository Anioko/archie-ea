"""
Autonomous Rationalization Proposal Service

Generates predictive TIME (Tolerate/Invest/Migrate/Eliminate) proposals by
clustering applications into actionable consolidation candidates. This is
proactive — it surfaces proposals from data, not just post-hoc summaries.

Design:
- Reads ApplicationRationalizationScore (existing TIME decisions)
- Reads ApplicationComponent (lifecycle, deployment, data_source)
- Clusters by: duplicate capability coverage, same lifecycle_status, same vendor
- Produces evidence-backed proposals with business rationale and remediation steps
