"""Capability Fact Sheet — the single-source-of-truth lens for one capability.

The Fact Sheet pattern proved itself on applications; a business architect lives
in *capabilities* and had no equivalent. This assembles everything the tool knows
about one business capability — identity and ownership, the maturity position
(where it is vs. where it needs to be), its strategic weight, the applications
that realise it, its sub-capabilities, and the ArchiMate element behind it (so
the blast-radius graph is one click away) — with the same completeness score that
makes the gaps in the record impossible to ignore.

Reads only; invents nothing. An unrecorded field is reported missing, never
filled with a plausible default.
