"""Opt-in AI-assist for diagram import.

The deterministic Lucid/Visio transformers are authoritative for everything they
can type from an explicit stencil class — an LLM there would only add variance.
This module handles the *remainder*: shapes the transformer could not type, and
relationships it had to drop because an endpoint was unresolved. It asks a
configured LLM to PROPOSE a type for each skipped shape and to propose the
dropped relationships between elements that WERE imported, and returns those as
suggestions only.

Nothing here writes to the database. The caller surfaces the suggestions in the
import-review screen; only the ones a human accepts are folded into the commit.
That keeps the system-of-record rule intact — the app never fabricates data, it
proposes and waits to be told yes.

If no LLM provider is configured the whole pass is skipped and the deterministic
import still succeeds; the return simply carries ``available: False`` with a
plain reason, mirroring the extract-from-image 503 behaviour.
