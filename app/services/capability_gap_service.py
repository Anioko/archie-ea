    Compute a coverage heatmap for unified capabilities against a scoped set of applications.

    For each unified capability, calculates how many of the scoped applications have an
    active mapping, then classifies coverage as:
      - 'gap'     : coverage_score < 0.3
      - 'partial' : 0.3 <= coverage_score <= 0.7
      - 'covered' : coverage_score > 0.7
