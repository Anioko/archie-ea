"""Can each persona finish their job using only what is on the screen?

Every other test in this repository navigates by typed URL.
`client.post("/api/risks", ...)` proves the endpoint works; it proves nothing
about whether a risk manager could FIND it. That distinction is the whole
subject of this file, and it is where this week's defects actually lived.

Two instruments already exist and neither closes this gap:

* the adversarial sweep asks "what happens if I do something hostile?" It found
  a cross-tenant counter leak, an ARB state machine that accepted `banana`, 89
  routes rendering a nonexistent entity and 55 endpoints 500ing on `page=-1`.
  Every one of those is a WRONG RESPONSE. It found nothing that returns a
  correct-but-useless response, because there is nothing wrong with the HTTP.
* the 66 journey tests assert outcomes at endpoints they address directly, so a
  screen can pass them while offering the user no route to that endpoint at all.

The defects the owner personally reported are all of the second kind: a table of
architecture gaps with no link, button or route to act on any of them (112 such
tables); a collapsed sidebar showing several destinations behind one glyph with
labels clipped to "All mo..."; a capability search that rendered perfectly and
returned HTTP 200 while saying it could not load its data. A dead end is a
valid 200.

So the rule here, and the only thing that makes this test different:

    NAVIGATE ONLY BY WHAT IS RENDERED.

Start at the persona's landing page and reach the goal by following links and
pressing controls that are actually present. Never type a URL. A step that
cannot be taken from the screen is a failure, and it is exactly the failure a
new user hits on their first afternoon.

These are ratcheted per archetype against task_completion_baseline.json rather
than asserted at zero, for the same reason every other ratchet exists: the debt
is real and being paid down, and a gate that fails on day one gets switched off.
