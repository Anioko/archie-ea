"""The ARB dashboard's "Review status" donut must actually render when there
is data to chart -- not just carry a <canvas> tag in the HTML.

Found 11 Sep 2026 in a visual-design pass on production: with exactly one
governed review item, the "Review status" card rendered as a large blank
card with only the legend numbers (Pending/Approved/Rejected, all reading 0)
floating in its bottom-right corner -- no visible donut at all. The existing
source-level tests in tests/test_arb_shell.py only assert the canvas element
is present in the returned HTML string, which passed throughout: the bug was
never in the markup, it was that the chart-building <script> lives in
extra_head_js (rendered inside <head>, before <body> -- and #arbStatusChart
-- exist), so `document.getElementById('arbStatusChart')` returned null on
every page load and the script bailed out silently with no console error.
Fixed by wrapping the chart construction in a DOMContentLoaded listener in
app/templates/arb/dashboard.html. This test proves the fix by checking for
an actual Chart.js instance attached to the canvas, which a source-only
HTML-string test cannot see.
