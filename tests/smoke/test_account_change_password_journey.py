"""Account settings: change-password is a real write path with no prior coverage.

Login/logout are already exercised implicitly by every persona fixture in
conftest.py's `_login` helper, and account creation/confirmation is a
separate onboarding flow out of scope here. But /account/manage/change-password
is a genuine, previously-untested write: this proves the new password is the
one that actually works by logging out and back in with it, not merely that
the form round-tripped with a flashed message.

This test rotates its subject's password by design (that is the whole point
of the assertion), so it must never run against a persona any other smoke
test relies on: `seeded` is session-scoped, and there is no cleanup step that
could safely restore a password without depending on ordering. Instead this
test creates its own disposable user, following the same
`User(...); user.password = PASSWORD` construction `seeded` uses in
conftest.py, so rotating this user's password can never poison another
test's sign-in.
