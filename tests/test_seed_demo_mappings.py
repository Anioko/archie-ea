"""The demo mapping seeder must stay inside the organisation it is given.

This seeder exists to make a demonstration tenant navigable: entities alone
(applications, capabilities, value streams) render as disconnected lists, and
every coverage view reads empty. It writes *sample* relationships, so the two
properties that matter are that it never escapes the organisation it was given,
and that it never invents an entity to hang a relationship on — an unknown name
is skipped and reported, not created.

    Two details are load-bearing. It runs outside `tenant_ctx`, because the
