"""Tenant isolation invariants.

Archie is multi-tenant, and isolation is not enforced by query code — it is
enforced by two SQLAlchemy event listeners in ``app/middleware/tenant_isolation.py``:

* ``do_orm_execute``  adds ``WHERE organization_id = g.current_org_id`` to ORM SELECTs
* ``before_flush``    sets ``organization_id`` on newly inserted ``TenantMixin`` rows

Nothing in the type system, and nothing a reviewer can see at a call site, tells
you whether a given query is scoped. That makes these tests the *only* mechanism
that can establish isolation holds. There are 55 ``TenantMixin`` models.

Two gaps are known and encoded below as strict xfails
-----------------------------------------------------
``do_orm_execute`` returns early for anything that is not a SELECT::

    if not orm_execute_state.is_select:
        return

and ``before_flush`` only walks ``session.new`` (inserts). So **bulk UPDATE and
bulk DELETE are not tenant-filtered at all**, even inside a request context. The
repository contains 35 bulk ``.update()`` / ``.delete()`` call sites.

Those two tests are marked ``xfail(strict=True)``: they document the gap without
breaking the build on pre-existing behaviour, and if the gap is ever closed the
strict xfail *fails*, forcing the marker to be removed. See
docs/adr/0003-tenant-isolation-gaps.md.

``test_get_by_id_is_tenant_scoped`` is NOT xfailed
--------------------------------------------------
Whether ``Query.get()`` honours ``with_loader_criteria`` decides whether
``app/api/v1/applications.py:482`` is a cross-tenant delete vector: that endpoint's
only authorisation check is a ``.get()`` returning None for a foreign id.

**Executed 2026-07-30: it PASSES** — ``.get()`` is scoped, so that endpoint is safe.
The test stays un-xfailed as a regression guard, because the endpoint's safety depends
on this behaviour continuing to hold. If it ever fails, that is a confirmed
cross-tenant delete, not a flaky test.

Suite status when last run: 6 passed, 2 xfailed (the two documented gaps).

    "``Query.get()`` *is* scoped (verified)". It is not.

    On an identity-map HIT, ``.get()`` returns the cached object without emitting
    SQL, so ``do_orm_execute`` never fires and no tenant predicate is applied. This
    test asserts that leaky behaviour deliberately: it documents a real property of
    SQLAlchemy rather than a defect we intend to fix, and it will fail loudly if a

    below can be relaxed.

    Consequence, and the reason this is written down: a single request is a single
    tenant on a single session, so request-handling code is unaffected. The exposure
    is code that loops over tenants *within one session* — CLI commands, the
