"""Implementation-domain genome slice: the deterministic Plateau -> WorkPackage
transformation roadmap slice + gantt emitter (ADR 0010, 3rd domain).

Asserts the properties the slice must prove, mirroring the proven coverage test:
  (a) real plateau and work-package names from the tenant render;
  (b) provenance resolves — structural for anchored rows, honestly synthetic
      (never a fabricated id) for a legitimately-unanchored row, and fail-closed
      for a dangling anchor;
  (c) DETERMINISM — building the slice twice yields byte-identical output
      (same spec_hash) and the emitted HTML is byte-identical.

Uses the SHARED fixtures in tests/conftest.py (db_session, make_org, tenant_ctx).
Seeds a small org with 2 plateaus, 3 work packages, and their ArchiMate elements.
