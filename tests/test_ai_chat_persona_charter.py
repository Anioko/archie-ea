"""The governed persona charters must reach the model on the live path.

`architect_persona_charters.py` holds each architect's charter, the six HARD
RULES (evidence, no fabrication, propose-don't-dispose, cite your source...) and
a per-persona live-data block. CLAUDE.md names this as the AI assistant's
governance layer.

It was reachable only through `MultiDomainChatService._get_persona_system_prompt`
← `process_message`. The live path is `POST /ai-chat/message` →
`AgentRunner.run()`, which never calls it. `AgentRunner`'s entire use of the
persona was one line:

    persona_note = f"\\nYou are operating as: {persona.replace('_',' ').title()}.\\n"

Eight words. Selecting "AI Data Architect" instead of "CIO" changed the prompt by
a job title and nothing else — the assistant was not governed by its charter, and
the HARD RULES that forbid fabricating application names and counts were never in
context.
