"""An answer about the portfolio must be checkable against the rows it came from.

Chat responses carried no provenance: the model could say "Salesforce is your CRM
system of record and is end-of-life in 2027" and the reader had no id, no link
and no way to tell a real row from a fluent invention. AIChatLinkService existed
with zero callers and would not have helped - it regex-matched the USER'S
QUESTION against a static map of dashboard URLs, producing generic page links
rather than record citations. AIHallucinationDetector likewise had zero callers.

Citations are derived from the tool results server-side rather than asked of the
model, because a citation the model writes is another claim, and the claim is
what is being verified.
