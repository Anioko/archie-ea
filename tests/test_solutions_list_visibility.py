"""The solutions list must not hide real work (S-01).

17 Aug 2026 QA addendum: `/solutions/` reported "Showing 6 solutions · Page 1
of 1" — an explicit assertion of completeness — while the API held 8. The
default view drops "empty draft shells", but judged emptiness on description
length alone, so a draft whose description box happened to be blank was hidden
regardless of how much architecture it carried. That hid solution 17, the only
solution in the entire instance with real content (4 elements, 3 relationships,
25% blueprint completeness, version 56): the single record that best
demonstrated the product was invisible, and the page said nothing was missing.

Note on attribution: the addendum blamed a `solution_type IS NULL` filter.
Measured against production, all three hidden rows were `status='draft'` with
zero-length descriptions, and `solution_type` is merely correlated — no query
filters on it. Fixing per the addendum's stated cause would have changed
nothing, which is why these tests pin the behaviour (is real work visible?)
rather than the mechanism.
