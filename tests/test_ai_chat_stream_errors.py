"""The /ai-chat stream must carry a failing backend's error to the client.

Design-review P0 wave, Task 3. The observed defect: with a failing LLM
backend, POST /ai-chat/message/stream answered 200 and the UI showed
nothing — no typing indicator, no error, 15s+ of dead air. The client half
(indicator, error card, 30s inactivity timeout) lives in
app/static/js/ai_chat/{transport,app}.js; this file pins the server half:
whatever the agent's failure mode, the SSE body must contain a ``done``
event that names the error, because that event is the only thing the
client can render.

Uses the shared fixtures in tests/conftest.py (db_session rolls back).
