"""A tenant must not be able to destroy another tenant's documents.

ApplicationDocument carries organization_id but is a plain db.Model, not a
TenantMixin one, so no WHERE organization_id = ... is injected and
.query.get_or_404() returns any tenant's row. Every handler therefore has to
check ownership itself.

Until 2026-07-31 the read path did and the delete path did not:

    download_document_file()  -> verify_file_access(parent_app.organization_id)
    delete_document_file()    -> (nothing)

so any authenticated user could walk integer ids and permanently remove another
tenant's document - the database row and the file on disk. Deletion is not
recoverable, which makes the omission worse on this path than on the read one
that was protected.

Both layouts register a delete route - /applications/... from app/modules/ and
/dashboard/... from the legacy app/application_mgmt/ - so fixing one left the
same hole open under a different URL. This asserts against the URL map for that
reason: it is the only view that sees both.
