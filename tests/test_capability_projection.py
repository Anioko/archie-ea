"""Behavioural tests for the business_capability -> unified_capabilities projection.

Each test works in a transaction-local cloned schema, so the shared test database's
real `unified_capabilities` is never projected into. This follows
`tests/test_capability_tenancy_cutover.py`, which established the pattern for the
sibling cutover command.

Fixtures come from `tests/conftest.py` (`db_session`, `app`, `make_org`,
`tenant_ctx`) — `db_session` runs each test inside a transaction that is always
rolled back, so a failure part-way through cannot leave residue. Do not hand-roll a
module-scoped `app` fixture here.

# ------------------------------------------------------------ write-time listeners
#
# The listeners under test are registered on the real BusinessCapability model
# class, but (like every sibling test above) they act on whatever
# `unified_capabilities` / `business_capability` the connection's search_path
# currently resolves to, not on a hardcoded schema name. Requesting
# `projection_schema` here gets these two tests a database that genuinely has the
# provenance index, without touching CI's schema-setup step or the unrelated
# `test_def003_capability_mapping_visible.py` fixtures that collide with it (see
# the T-001 bucket's defect report, D-002). db_session's per-test rollback keeps
# this from leaving residue, exactly as for the disposable-schema tests above.
#
# `_provenance_index_available`'s cache (`business_capabilities.py:631`) is keyed
# on the connection's engine URL alone, not on schema/search_path, so it cannot
# tell "index present in this test's clone" apart from "index present in the real,
# un-migrated public schema" that every other test in the suite runs against.
# `_cleared_provenance_cache` below makes that cache irrelevant across the
# boundary of these two tests: cleared on setup so this test's own clone is what
# gets observed rather than a stale entry from an earlier test, and cleared again
# on teardown so this test's True does not leak into whatever runs next in the
# same pytest process.
