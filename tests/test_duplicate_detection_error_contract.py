"""A failed AI duplicate-detection run must not be reported as HTTP 200.

The adversarial sweep found ``POST /duplicate-detection/ai/api/detect`` and
``/api/compare`` returning **HTTP 200** with
``{"error": "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'generate_embeddings'"}`` - a
raw Python ``AttributeError`` handed to the client as a successful response.

Three defects sat behind that one payload:

1. ``AIDuplicateDetectionService._ensure_engines()`` existed but was never
   called from anywhere, so ``self.semantic_engine`` was still ``None`` on
   first use.
2. The service's ``except`` branch put ``str(e)`` into the response body,
   leaking an internal traceback detail to an unauthenticated-adjacent caller.
3. The routes did ``return jsonify(result)`` without looking at
   ``result["success"]``, so a failure was served with a 200 status.

These tests pin the resulting contract rather than the bug: a failed run is a
5xx-class *status*, and its message is written in the product's terms with no
Python type or attribute name in it.
