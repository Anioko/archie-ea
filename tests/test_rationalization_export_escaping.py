"""RationalizationExportService.generate_pdf interpolated app.name (a
user-entered application name) into a hand-built HTML report with zero
escaping. Found 11 Sep 2026 while triaging the raw-html-escaping gate.

Uses a monkeypatched get_scored_apps rather than a full DB fixture, since
the escaping bug is entirely in string formatting downstream of that call.
