"""The ARB conformance gate must judge all four architecture domains.

TOGAF ADM treats Business (Phase B), Data and Application (Phase C) and
Technology (Phase D) as peers. The reviewer shipped with four rule categories —
integration, clean_core, technology, deployment — of which only one, a binary
"are there any technology elements at all", concerned an architecture domain.
Business and Data had **no rules whatsoever**, so a solution could reach
"board-ready" while naming no business process it changes and no data it
creates, classifies or retains.

These tests pin the two missing domains. They follow the reviewer's existing
convention deliberately: a solution with nothing modelled yet is not in breach
(see `_technology_findings`, which returns [] when total == 0) — the gate judges
incomplete designs, not empty ones.
