"""Cross-tenant isolation for the raw SQL in app/services.

Multi-tenancy is enforced by the ``do_orm_execute`` listener in
``app/middleware/tenant_isolation.py``, which rewrites ORM statements. A
``db.text(...)`` statement is not an ORM statement, so none of that applies to
it: every query here reached PostgreSQL exactly as written and returned every
organisation's rows.

Several of these services assemble the context handed to the AI assistant. An
unscoped read there does not merely leak a row — the model restates it to the
user in fluent prose as though it were their own portfolio. That is why the
assertions below are about *absence of the other tenant's data*, not just about
counts.

Written against the shared fixtures in tests/conftest.py: ``db_session`` runs
each test inside a transaction that is always rolled back, so nothing lands in
the shared test database.
