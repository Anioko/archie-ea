"""The generic ArchiMate element create modal previously posted only
element_type/name/description, even though ``services/field_configs.py``
defines typed fields (e.g. BusinessActor.actor_type) for many element types.
Those configs were passed into the dashboard template context but never
referenced by it (dead data), and the create POST handler never received the
typed values in the first place.

This closes the gap end to end:
  - dashboard.html renders typed fields for the selected type from
    ``window.__APP_CONFIG__.fieldConfigs`` (services/field_configs.py,
    exposed by the ``dashboard``/``list_elements``/``create_element`` routes).
  - dashboard.js includes those typed values in the create/update POST body.
  - ``create_element`` (routes.py) already called ``_set_model_fields`` for
    typed fields on create — the same helper PATCH-style updates use — it
    was just never handed anything to apply. ``_set_model_fields`` now also
    draws its allowed-field list from ``get_element_field_names(element_type)``
    (field_configs.py) in addition to its legacy hard-coded table, so any
    field the create modal can render is also a field the server will persist.

Covers:
  1. Creating a BusinessActor with a typed field (``actor_type``) persists it.
  2. Creating a type with no field_configs.py entry (Contract) still works
     with just name + description — unchanged behaviour.
  3. A bogus/unknown field name in the create payload is ignored, not a 500 —
     ``_set_model_fields``'s ``hasattr(element, field)`` guard already
     enforces this; this pins that create's payload doesn't bypass it.

Tenant note: BusinessActor and Contract both inherit ``TenantMixin``, whose
``organization_id`` column is NOT NULL. It is auto-set only when
``g.current_org_id`` is populated, which the ``tenant_context`` middleware's
``before_request`` hook does *unconditionally* from ``current_user`` on every
request (setting it back to None for an unauthenticated caller) — so merely
flipping ``LOGIN_DISABLED`` (which skips the ``@login_required`` check but
does not log anyone in) is not enough here: the request would still 500 on
the NOT NULL constraint. These tests instead fake a real Flask-Login session
for a real User row pinned to a real Organization, exactly the pattern
``tests/test_ba_tenant_and_authz.py::_login`` uses for the same reason.
