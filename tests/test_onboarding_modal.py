"""The onboarding modal must not interrogate a user who already has a role.

Found by driving a real browser: signing in as the SG Tadley business architect
put a "Welcome to A.R.C.H.I.E. — What's your role?" modal over the dashboard.
Three things were wrong with that, in ascending order of severity:

  1. It blocks the first screen of the product for a user who is not onboarding.
  2. Its list of eight roles did not include ``business_architect`` — the role
     that user actually holds. Production carries nine.
  3. Completing it POSTs ``enterprise_role`` to
     /dashboard/api/onboarding-complete, so answering the question **overwrites
     the real role**, silently re-scoping the sidebar and permissions. A user
     whose role is missing from the list cannot answer correctly, so the only
     available outcomes were "wrong role" or "dismiss".

The modal is now gated on the user having no ``enterprise_role`` at all, and
``business_architect`` is a first-class option for those who genuinely need it.
