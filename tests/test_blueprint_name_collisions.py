"""Routes that exist in the source must exist in the URL map.

Where two Flask blueprints share a name, only one can win: Flask 3 rejects the
second registration, ``app/_bootstrap/blueprints.py`` catches it non-fatally, and
the loser's routes vanish with nothing raised. Boot-health still sees a registered
blueprint of that name, so the page simply 404s. See the "blueprint name
collisions" section of ``docs/known-issues/unreachable-pages.md``.

Two pages were reachable in the source and not on the web:

* ``/admin/security`` — its blueprint was declared and imported by nothing at all.
* ``/dashboard/capability-heatmap`` — served by dashboard v1, dropped by the v2
  rewrite that superseded it, with the template and its API both still live.

Database-free, like ``tests/test_boot_health.py``: everything here is url_map.
