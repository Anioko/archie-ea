"""The executive Health Score must not present one lightly-weighted, single
measured component as a confident whole-portfolio number.

Confirmed live on 6 Sep 2026 (Archie-E2E-Workflow-Test-Report.md E2E-M): a
clean tenant with 0 solutions, 0 capabilities and one newly created,
unresolved ARB review reported "Health Score: 90" - phase maturity, risk
posture and capability coverage all had nothing to measure and dropped out
of the weighted composite, leaving only governance (nominal weight 0.1),
whose value then received 100% of the visible score after renormalisation.
A single freshly-created ARB item should not be able to produce a
confident-looking 90/100 for an otherwise entirely unmeasured portfolio.
