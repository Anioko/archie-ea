"""Every gate must be watched failing, on every run — not once, by hand.

docs/TESTING_STANDARD.md rule 7 has always required it: "Reintroduce the defect,
watch the gate go red, restore, watch it go green. A checker nobody has seen fail
is just a number." The evidence-contract gate enforces that a checker CARRIES a
`Proven-against:` line, which is a claim that someone once did that. This file
turns the claim into a measurement that reruns forever.

Twice today a gate written in this session reported 0 while the defect it was
built for sat right there in the tree:

* the first `authz-widening` probe left the `Permission` import in place, so the
  gate correctly saw a permission check and stayed green — and for a few minutes
  I believed a fake gate was real;
* the first `ai-untrusted-content` probe wrote a broken f-string, the checker's
  `except SyntaxError` skipped the file, and it reported 0 for a defect that was
  present.

Both were caught by chance. A gate that cannot fail is worse than no gate,
because it is counted as coverage — which is the whole thesis of this codebase.

Every checker here accepts `--root`, so each case builds a MINIMAL synthetic
tree containing exactly the defect and runs the checker against it. Nothing in
the real repository is mutated, the cases are independent, and they can run in
parallel. Each case asserts both directions: the bad tree is non-zero AND the
clean tree is zero. Asserting only "red" would pass for a checker that returns a
positive count for everything.

Two checkers are deliberately absent from the --root convention, and naming
them is the point -- a hollow case in THIS file would defeat the file.

check_canonical_route.py reads a BOOTED url_map, because a static scan of
@route decorators cannot see a blueprint's url_prefix, cannot see which side
the USE_*_GUARDRAILS flags selected, and cannot see that init_blueprints
logged an import failure and carried on. Its collision logic is therefore kept
separate from the booting, and it IS pinned red-and-green below against a
hand-built two-blueprint Flask app.

check_evidence_contract.py reads real git history and the verify.py registry,
and has no --root, so a synthetic tree cannot drive it. Its rule-2 substance is covered directly instead, by
test_every_registered_checker_carries_its_proof below. Naming the exclusion is
the point -- a hollow case in THIS file would defeat the file.

check_reuse.py DOES take --root, but it also takes a required --rule (RG-1,
RG-1b or RG-2), which the shared CASES/_run_checker convention above has no
room for -- _run_checker always calls a script with exactly --count --root.
Rather than widen that helper for one checker, its rules are pinned
red-and-green directly, below the CASES-driven test.
