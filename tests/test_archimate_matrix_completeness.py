"""The conformance matrix must know every ArchiMate 3.2 concept it validates.

The matrix held 58 of the 61 concepts. Grouping, Location and Junction were
absent, and because validation is an exact-pair lookup, an absent concept does
not fail loudly - `get_valid_relationships` returns an empty list, which reads
as "the specification permits nothing here" rather than "this concept is
unknown to me".

That distinction matters because the two are indistinguishable to every caller.
A Grouping aggregating its members is the most ordinary construct in ArchiMate
and the matrix reported it as a conformance error, which is how the Lucid
importer came to drop nested structure entirely.

These tests pin the concepts and a sample of their rules. They deliberately do
not restate the whole specification - that is what the matrix is - but they do
guard the shape of it, and they fail if a concept silently disappears again.
