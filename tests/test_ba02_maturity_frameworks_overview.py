"""BA-02: the capability-maturity frameworks overview must show real numbers.

The stats query in `frameworks_overview()` had been gutted — it built a
placeholder string and a params dict, discarded both, and left `framework_stats`
empty. Every card is guarded by `{% if stats and stats[0] > 0 %}`, so the page
rendered blank and the feature read as "a Maturity view that populates no score".

These tests pin the numbers, the tenant predicate (raw SQL, so ADR-0003 means no
ORM filter is injected), and the column ORDER, which the template reads
positionally as stats[0], [1], [2], [4], [5].
