"""A capability health score must come from a measurement, or not exist.

The 30 Aug 2026 QA audit, Medium #5:

    "Every domain ... shows an identical 60% score, aligning with 0/191
     capabilities having any recorded maturity assessment, suggesting the health
     formula falls back to a fixed default when inputs are missing instead of
     surfacing an honest 'not assessed' state... The dashboard's headline claim
     of a 'real-time assessment... based on maturity, coverage, and technical
     risk' is misleading -- a user could conclude the portfolio has meaningfully
     differentiated health when no real assessment has occurred."

The reading was right and the diagnosis was slightly off, which makes it worse
rather than better. 60 is not a hardcoded default: the formula starts at 100,
subtracts nothing for an unknown maturity gap, subtracts 40 for having no
applications, and lands on exactly 60 every time. A number with no measurement
behind it, arrived at honestly by arithmetic, and rendered identically to a
measured one.

CLAUDE.md: "A 0 that means 'not computed' is indistinguishable from a measured
zero; use None -> em dash." These tests hold that line for 60.
