"""Pins the AI chat approval-execution path reported in the 17 Aug 2026 QA
sweep: the approve route previously called AIChatApprovalService's
approve_approval, a method that never existed (AttributeError -> 500), so
the queue could be polled but never actually executed. Fixed in
app/modules/ai_chat/routes/approval_routes.py to call approve_and_execute
instead — this test pins that the route (not just the service) actually
mutates the target record end-to-end.

Uses the shared fixtures in tests/conftest.py.
