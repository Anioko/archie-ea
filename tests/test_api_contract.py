"""What every /api/ endpoint promises its callers, enforced across all 341 of them.

Contract tests usually pin one endpoint's response shape at a time. That does not
scale here - the front end calls dozens of endpoints, and pinning each one field
by field produces a suite that breaks on every harmless addition while missing
the failures that actually take the product down.

The failures that matter are cross-cutting, so the assertions are too:

  1. An /api/ path answers in JSON, always - including when it refuses. A front
     end that asks for JSON and receives an HTML error page dies at JSON.parse,
     and the user sees a generic script error instead of "you do not have
     access". The refusal was correct; the explanation was lost.

  2. An /api/ path does not answer an anonymous caller with 200. Anything that
     legitimately does is named in PUBLIC below, with the reason.

Both were found broken by driving every route rather than reading decorators.
Nine vendor endpoints returned HTTP 200 with all-null bodies to anonymous
callers, because @api.marshal_with sat ABOVE @login_required - decorators apply
bottom-up, so login_required produced its 401 and marshal_with then marshalled
that response object through the schema, yielding a 200 full of nulls. The view
body never ran and no data escaped, but the endpoints advertised success to
anyone who asked. Three more served HTML to JSON callers.

Reading the source would not have found either one. Both look correct.
