"""The opening screen reads this tenant's portfolio — and every state is designed.

/ai-chat/recommendations answers 500 with {"error": ..., "alerts": [],
"recommendations": [], "summary": {"total": 0}}. That body is indistinguishable
from "nothing to report" unless the status is checked, so an outage would render
as a clean portfolio and a health score of 0%.

CLAUDE.md names this exact failure: fetch does not reject on 404/500, and
`if (response.ok)` with no `else` leaves metrics at their 0 initialiser, where a
0 meaning "not computed" cannot be told apart from a measured zero.
