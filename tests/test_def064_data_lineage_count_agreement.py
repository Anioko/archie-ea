"""DEF-064, Capgemini dry-run: /architecture/data-architecture's "Flows"
tile counted DataLineage rows only, while /architecture/data-lineage's
"Recorded lineage edges" counts those same rows PLUS ArchiMateRelationship
edges between DataObjects (drawn via the composer/import, not through this
page) — two different definitions of "how much lineage exists" answering
differently. The dashboard now counts both, same as the lineage page.
