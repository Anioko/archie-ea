"""Prove tenant isolation empirically, and pin the models that opt out.

Multi-tenant leakage is the defect that ends an enterprise deal, and this
codebase enforces isolation through a SQLAlchemy event listener rather than
through query code - so nothing in a route tells you whether it is working. It
either applies or it silently does not.

This file asserts three things:

  1. TenantMixin actually filters. Two organisations, rows in each, and a query
     from inside one request context must never return the other's row. That is
     a positive control on the mechanism, not on any particular route.
  2. The set of models carrying organization_id WITHOUT the mixin is a fixed,
     justified list. Adding a new one is a decision someone has to make
     explicitly, not something that happens by omission.
  3. Bulk UPDATE and DELETE are documented as bypassing the filter entirely, and
     that remains true - so the documentation stays honest and anyone writing a
     bulk write knows they must scope it themselves.

The gap this closes was real: ApplicationDocument carries organization_id but no
mixin, and the delete handler forgot to scope, so any authenticated user could
destroy any tenant's document by walking integer ids.
