"""A response's query count must not grow with the number of rows it returns.

The obvious way to gate performance is to assert a page renders in under N
milliseconds. That measures the CI runner's mood: slower on a shared box,
faster on a warm cache, and the usual response to the resulting flake is to
raise the threshold until the check means nothing.

Query count is the honest measurement. It is identical on every machine, and it
catches the thing that actually makes a server-rendered page slow: a loop that
issues one query per row. Thirty applications is fine against a local database;
twelve thousand across a network round trip is a page that never finishes.
Saint-Gobain's portfolio is the second case.

So rather than pin an absolute number - which would need rebaselining whenever a
feature adds a legitimate query - this renders the same endpoint twice with
different row counts and asserts the difference stays flat.

Two things this file is careful about, both learned by getting them wrong:

  * It measures /api/applications/table-data, not the /applications/ HTML page.
    The HTML page caps how many rows it lists, so its query count cannot grow
    with row count no matter how bad the code is - a test against it passes
    unconditionally. The API serialises every row up to per_page=50, so it is
    the surface where an N+1 actually shows.

  * The first request to any endpoint issues extra one-off statements (metadata
    reflection, feature-flag loading). Measuring it makes the first count higher
    than the second and hides real growth - the first draft of this file
    "passed" while asserting queries had DECREASED. Every measurement is now
    preceded by a discarded warm-up request.

test_the_detector_catches_a_known_n_plus_one is a positive control: a route that
deliberately queries per row. If that test ever passes quietly, the measurement
has stopped working and every other assertion here is worthless.
