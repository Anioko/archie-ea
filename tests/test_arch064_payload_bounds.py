"""Regression test for ARCH-064 (S3, partial remainder): the architecture
dashboard's static per-element-type field configuration was being
re-serialised into every page load via ``tojson``, even though it never
changes per request or per tenant. Moved to a fetched endpoint
(``archimate_crud.api_field_configs``) in
``app/modules/architecture/routes/archimate_crud/routes.py``.

Measured with a near-empty database (matching how this finding was
originally measured):

    /capability-map/          before 477,490 bytes  after 477,490 bytes (untouched this wave)
    /architecture/dashboard   before 187,069 bytes  after 169,857 bytes (-17,212 bytes / -9.2%)

This test pins two things: the dashboard response no longer inlines the
field-config JSON, and the new endpoint serves the same data the template
used to embed directly, so the create/edit modal isn't silently broken by
the split.

capability-map/ is now bounded too. Its five "map applications to X"
dialogs (mapping-modal, acm-mapping-modal, process-mapping-modal,
apqc-mapping-modal, archimate-mapping-modal) are all closed on arrival, so
they are no longer serialised into the initial HTML: they are fetched from
``capability_map.mapping_modal_partial`` on first open and injected into
``#lazy-modal-host``. Measured with the same harness as the tests below
(near-empty flask_test database, admin session):

    /capability-map/          before 436,618 bytes  after 368,193 bytes (-68,425 bytes / -15.7%)

De-duplicating the three near-copies into ``capability_map/_mapping_modal.html``
(the earlier wave) moved this number by zero, because the macro still rendered
all three. Not rendering them is what made the difference.
