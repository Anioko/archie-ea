"""Model ids must be current, and must live in one place.

Every Claude id in the tree had gone stale, several to RETIRED models that now
return 404 - including the v2 admin default (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, retired
2025-10-28) and the example shown to operators in api_settings.html. The newest
Claude referenced anywhere was Haiku 4.5, so the Anthropic path either called a
model that no longer exists or routed enterprise-architecture reasoning through
the cheapest tier available.

They drifted because they were hardcoded in six places. These tests pin both the
currency and the single source of truth.
