"""Relationship keys a business case's options, outcomes and plan items need
to link, pinned against the one relationship validity authority.

``app/config/archimate_relationship_matrix.py`` is that authority.
``app/models/archimate_core.py`` ``VALID_RELATIONSHIPS`` (the coarse
``(relationship, source_layer, target_layer)`` table) and
``ArchimateValidityService`` (the fine-grained, element-type service the
picker route calls) are both adapters over it now, so a key present in one
is present in the other by construction — the drift test below guards that
construction, not two independently-authored tables:

  option <-> plan item                 (association, strategy <-> implementation)
  capability / resource hierarchies    (aggregation, strategy, strategy)
  outcome <-> work package             (association, motivation <-> implementation)
  resource assigned to capability      (assignment, strategy, strategy)
  key partner <-> resource/capability  (association, business <-> strategy)

This module pins: those keys in both adapters; a representative set of the
canvas zones' other relationships, so this change is proven not to have
moved them; that the two adapters cannot silently drift apart; and one
refused combination per relationship type this change touches.
