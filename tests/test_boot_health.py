"""Boot health — the gate that makes silent degradation loud.

Why this file exists
--------------------
``app/_bootstrap/blueprints.py`` registers every module behind ``try/except``
(~100 handlers) so one broken import degrades a single feature instead of taking
down the app. That resilience is deliberate and worth keeping, but on its own it
means a module can stop registering with **no failing test and no error** — the
first symptom is a Jinja ``BuildError`` 500 on every page whose chrome calls
``url_for()`` on one of the vanished endpoints. Because the sidebar renders on
every admin page, a single missing registration can 500 the whole product.

These tests close that loop. They are deliberately **database-free**:
``create_app()`` boots fine with no PostgreSQL (connection errors are caught and
logged), so this suite runs in CI without a database service and catches the
class of regression that the DB-backed tests never reach.

Kept strict on purpose. All four assertions passed on a clean tree when written
(3364 view functions, 0 registration failures, 0 unresolved endpoints across 533
templates) — so any failure here is a real regression, not pre-existing debt.
