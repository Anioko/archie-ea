"""Realization may only target a more abstract entity (ArchiMate 3.2 §5.1.3).

Regression cover for QA finding C-01: the composer's relationship picker offered
Realization for ``ApplicationComponent -> BusinessActor`` while correctly refusing it
for ``BusinessActor -> ApplicationComponent``. The cross-layer rule granted realization
on layer RANK alone and never looked at the target's aspect, so the same element pair
validated differently depending on which way it was drawn — and an invalid relationship
reached the database.

These assertions are deliberately direction-explicit: a pair the specification forbids
must be forbidden BOTH ways round, so a future per-direction edit cannot re-open the gap
on one side only.
