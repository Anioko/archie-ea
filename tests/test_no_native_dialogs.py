"""Shipped templates must not use the browser's own alert() or confirm().

DESIGN.md has said so for a long time and 20 call sites had accumulated anyway,
which is what happens to a rule with nothing enforcing it.

The reasons are not cosmetic:

  - They block the browser thread. Nothing renders, no timer fires, and any
    automation driving the page stops dead until a human clicks - which is also
    why they break the Playwright smoke journeys.
  - They cannot be styled or translated, so an enterprise product shows a Chrome
    dialog captioned "127.0.0.1 says" to a Fortune 500 buyer.
  - Chrome suppresses them after repeated use and inside cross-origin iframes.
    A delete guard that silently stops appearing is worse than no guard: the
    user still expects to be asked.

Platform.confirm() and Platform.alert() (core/07-dialog.js) are the
replacements. Both return a promise, so:

    if (await Platform.confirm('Delete this?')) doDelete();

This is an absolute gate rather than a ratchet, because the count is zero and
the fix for a new one is a two-line edit. A ratchet would be the right shape if
there were a backlog to burn down; there is not.
