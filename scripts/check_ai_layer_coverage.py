"""What an ArchiMate practitioner can model, and what the AI can model for them.

The owner's goal for this product, stated 31 Aug 2026: architecture should not
be exclusive to organisations that can afford a team of architects. That means
the AI has to do the practitioner's job, not assist with it -- and the first
question is simply *how much of ArchiMate 3.2 can it actually produce*.

Measured when this gate was written: `_ELEMENT_TYPE_LAYER` in
app/models/archimate_core.py declares 58 element types across the seven layers
(technology 13, business 13, motivation 10, application 9, implementation 5,
strategy 4, physical 4). The AI agent has 37 write tools, of which the dedicated
element-creation ones cover FIVE types -- driver, goal, constraint, requirement
and risk, all motivation.

So the assistant can reason about why an architecture exists and design
solutions, and cannot model the business, technology, strategy or migration
layers, which is most of the notation and most of the work.

There is a generic `create_archimate_element` that will emit any type it is
told to. That is deliberately NOT counted as coverage, and the distinction is
the whole point of this gate: emitting a typed node is not the same as knowing
that a Business Process is a behaviour owned by a Business Actor while a
Business Function groups behaviour by capability. A practitioner's value is in
choosing the right element and relating it correctly. A tool that accepts a
type string pushes that judgement back onto the user -- which is the situation
this product exists to remove.

Not every type needs its own tool, and some never will: Physical (equipment,
facility, distribution network, material) matters to manufacturing estates and
almost nobody else. Say so with the escape hatch rather than leaving the number
misleadingly high.

A RATCHET, and one that should fall steadily. Each element type that gains a
proper AI creation path -- one that knows the type's semantics and its legal
relationships -- is a piece of the practitioner's job the product does for
someone who cannot hire one.

Escape hatch: `ai-layer-ok: <reason>` beside the type in the layer map, for a
type genuinely out of scope. Say why, and who models it instead.

Proven-against: `_tool_create_driver` renamed in the executor -- the count rises
by one naming `driver`, and returns when restored. Pinned red-and-green on a

    Grepping alone missed them entirely. The per-type tools are installed onto

    is no literal `def _tool_create_business_process` to find. This checker
