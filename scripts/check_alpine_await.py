"""Find `await` / `async` inside an inline Alpine expression, where it silently lies.

Why this is a data-integrity gate, not a style gate
---------------------------------------------------
Archie serves its pages under a CSP with no ``'unsafe-eval'``, so Alpine
expressions written in HTML attributes are not run by the browser's JS engine.
They are parsed and executed by our own interpreter,
``app/static/js/csp/csp-evaluator.js`` -- a synchronous tree-walking evaluator.
That evaluator has no event loop and no coroutine machinery, so it treats
``await`` as a **pass-through**: the unary case returns its operand unchanged
(``case 'await': return a;``). ``async`` is worse -- it is not in the
evaluator's keyword table at all, so ``async load() { ... }`` inside an
``x-data`` object literal is a parse error and the *entire component* fails to
initialise.

The pass-through is the dangerous one, because nothing breaks visibly. Written
in an attribute,

    x-data="{ total: 0, async init() { this.total = await api.count(); } }"

assigns the *Promise object* to ``this.total`` -- or, once the parse fails,
leaves it at its initialiser. Either way the tile renders the literal ``0`` the
component was seeded with, and a reader cannot distinguish that from a measured
zero. That is exactly what happened: the strategic-roadmap statistic tiles
(``app/templates/strategic_roadmap/enhanced_roadmap_fixed.html``) and the sprint
burndown/velocity charts (``app/templates/sprints/charts.html``) both sat on
fabricated zeros for months, on pages that looked perfectly healthy. Archie is a
system of record; a screen that shows a plausible number it never measured is
worse than one that shows nothing, because the user acts on it.

The fix at each site is a promise chain -- ``.then()`` / ``.catch()`` -- which
the evaluator executes correctly, because the callbacks are ordinary closures
it hands to the real Promise implementation. On the failure path the value must
go to ``null``, never ``0`` and never ``''``, so the UI renders an em dash.

What is NOT flagged
-------------------
``await`` inside a ``<script>`` block is ordinary JavaScript run by the browser
and is completely fine -- including ``Alpine.data('foo', () => ({ async init()
{...} }))``, because that factory is browser-evaluated and only its *return
value* reaches Alpine. This checker therefore looks only at Alpine attribute
expressions (``x-data``, ``x-init``, ``x-effect``, ``x-on:*`` / ``@*``, and
every other ``x-``/``@`` attribute), never at script bodies. It also ignores
``await`` appearing inside a string literal or a JS comment within such an
attribute, and masks Jinja ``{{ ... }}`` / ``{% ... %}`` regions first so that
constructs like ``replace("'", "\\'")`` inside a double-quoted attribute do not
desynchronise attribute parsing.

Escape hatch: append ``alpine-await-ok: <reason>`` on the flagged line or the
line above it.

    python scripts/check_alpine_await.py --count    # trailing line = count
