"""Front-end surfaces that cannot work, checked against the real route table.

Every other gate proves a page renders. None of them proves the things ON that
page go anywhere. This boots the app, takes its url_map, and resolves what the
templates and scripts actually point at.

Classes, each a distinct user-visible failure:

  dead-link      href="/x" where no route matches /x. The user clicks and gets
                 a 404 on a link the product itself rendered.
  dead-fetch     fetch('/api/x') where no route matches. The request 404s, and
                 combined with a silent `if (r.ok)` guard the user sees nothing
                 at all. (check_dead_interactions.py covers the guard; this
                 covers the target.)
  swallowed      catch blocks whose entire body is empty or a lone console call.
                 The failure happened, the user was told nothing, and no
                 telemetry recorded it.
  form-no-action <form> with neither an action nor a submit handler: pressing
                 Enter reloads the page and loses what was typed.
  forbidden-ui   alert() / confirm() in shipped UI code. DESIGN.md forbids both;
                 they are unstyled, unblockable and untestable.
  orphan-page    a template that extends a layout — so it is a PAGE, not a
                 partial — that no render_template() call names and no other
                 template includes. It cannot be reached by any URL. Either
                 dead code, or a feature that was built and never wired up.

Dynamic URLs (anything containing a template expression or string
concatenation) are skipped rather than guessed at — a false positive here costs
more attention than it saves.
