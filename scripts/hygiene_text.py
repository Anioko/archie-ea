"""Text-masking primitives shared by more than one scripts/check_*.py
static-analysis script.

The common shape across these checkers: find a span of text that should
not be read as the thing being searched for (a comment, a Jinja
expression, an HTML tag), and blank it out -- every character replaced by
a space, except a newline, which stays a newline -- rather than delete it,
so every other match's line and column position in the surrounding text
stays correct. One definition of that primitive and the handful of
comment/markup patterns built on it, imported by each checker that needs
one, rather than a separate copy re-typed in every file.

Not every name here is used by every importer, and two related pairs are
kept deliberately apart rather than unified into one:

* `HTML_TAG_RE` requires at least one interior character (an empty `<>` is
  not a real tag in the caller that uses it); `HTML_TAG_RE_LOOSE` allows
  zero and is DOTALL, for a caller masking a tag to read what is left
  between and around it rather than matching the tag as a unit of text.
* `blank_comments()` is a single left-to-right character scan: an
  unterminated `/*` or `{#` with no closing delimiter blanks to
  end-of-file (whatever follows an unclosed comment marker was meant to be
  inside it). `js_comment_spans()` is regex-based and returns each span
  rather than blanking in place, for a caller that reports a line number
  per comment; it requires a closing `*/` to match a block comment at all,
  so an unterminated one is left unmatched rather than consuming the rest
  of the file. Both are kept, each behind the name the shape it solves
  needs.
