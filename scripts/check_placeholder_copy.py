"""A label that says "Field" satisfies every rule and tells the user nothing.

Found 31 Aug 2026 by the owner, in the capability map's "Map Applications to"
dialog on the deployed site:

    <label for="application-search">Field</label>

53 of these are in the templates. capability_map/index.html alone has 33.

Every gate in this repository passed it, and the reason is worth stating plainly
because it is a class of blindness rather than a missed case:

* the axe-core accessibility audit passes, because "Field" IS a valid accessible
  name -- axe checks that a control HAS a label, never that the label means
  anything;
* nav-label-clarity only reads the sidebar;
* rendered-legibility measures clipping and icon ambiguity, not whether words
  carry information;
* task-completion asks whether a persona can REACH a screen, and stops at the
  door -- nothing in the estate opens a dialog and looks inside it.

That last point is the structural one. In this product the modal IS the work:
mapping applications to capabilities is the core workflow, and forms were the
one surface no instrument examined.

The general failure is that gates check PRESENCE and not MEANING. A label
exists, so it passes. An icon exists, so it passes. It is the same shape as
eight destinations behind one `layout-dashboard` glyph: each individually
valid, collectively useless.

Detection: a <label>, <th>, <button>, <h1>-<h4> or aria-label whose entire
visible text is a placeholder word -- Field, Label, Text, Input, Value, Title,
Name here, TODO, TBD, Lorem, Untitled, Placeholder, Header, Column, Item,
Description, Sample, Example, Foo, Bar, Test.

Deliberately NOT flagged: the word inside a longer phrase ("Field name",
"Custom field"), which is ordinary English; anything inside a Jinja expression,
since `{{ field.label }}` renders whatever the form supplies; and <option>
elements, where "Name" is a legitimate sort key.

Escape hatch: `placeholder-copy-ok: <reason>` on the line -- for a genuine
generic macro whose caller supplies the real word. Say who supplies it.

    python scripts/check_placeholder_copy.py
    python scripts/check_placeholder_copy.py --count

Proven-against: a label changed to "Field" in a template -- the count rises by
one naming that line, and returns when the real word is restored. Pinned
red-and-green on a synthetic tree by tests/test_gates_actually_fail.py.
