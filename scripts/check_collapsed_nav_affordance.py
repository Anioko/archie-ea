"""A collapsed sidebar with no tooltips is a row of unlabelled buttons.

The UI / interaction architect's question, per CLAUDE.md: "what does this look
like in its non-default states -- collapsed, narrow, empty, overflowing?"

Written 31 Aug 2026 from a screenshot of this product's own sidebar, collapsed.
components/admin_sidebar.html implements the collapsed state as a width change
and nothing else:

    :style="{ width: $store.sidebar.collapsed ? '4rem' : '16rem' }"

The label is rendered unconditionally inside a span carrying `flex-1 truncate`,
so collapsing does not HIDE the labels -- it CLIPS them. The rail ends up
showing "All mo..." and "Bui..." beside icons, with no tooltip and nothing
anywhere saying what an icon means. Measured at the time: 10 of 12
icon-bearing nav anchors carried neither title nor aria-label.

This is the class of defect that survived seventy green gates, because every
other gate here reads source for STRUCTURE rather than for what a person ends
up looking at. The axe-core audit passes a link whose accessible name comes
from its clipped text. dead-interactions passes, because the link works.
design-tokens passes, because the colours are right. The screen is still
unusable, and nothing in the estate had eyes.

Detection: an anchor in a sidebar/nav template that contains an icon
(data-lucide) and carries neither title= nor aria-label= on the anchor itself.
Those two are what survive the visible label being hidden or clipped.

Escape hatch: `collapsed-nav-ok: <reason>`, for an anchor that is never
rendered inside a collapsible rail.

    python scripts/check_collapsed_nav_affordance.py
    python scripts/check_collapsed_nav_affordance.py --count

Proven-against: the title attribute removed from a sidebar nav anchor -- the
count rises by one naming that file and line, and returns when restored. Pinned
red-and-green on a synthetic tree by tests/test_gates_actually_fail.py.
