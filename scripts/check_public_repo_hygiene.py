r"""Three checks over this repository's tracked files and commit history.

1. No `docs/buckets/` directory tracked in this repository. (zero)
2. No tracked source file (app/, scripts/, tests/, templates) contains the
   literal string `docs/buckets/`. (zero)
3. No review-record-id token or process word, in a comment, docstring or
   string literal under app/, scripts/, tests/, templates or static JS, or
   in a commit message. A record-id token is a short letter-and-digit code
   this shape of review uses (see RECORD_ID_PATTERN below); a process word
   names a reviewing function rather than the change itself (see
   ROLE_WORDS below). Neither belongs in this repository's own source or
   history: both describe review machinery, not the product.

Two allowlists keep rule 3 from matching this codebase's own conventions:
RECORD_ID_ALLOWLIST_PREFIXES excludes this codebase's business-reference-
number families (architecture-decision, finding, task and deliverable
references) and the pre-existing standards-body, quarter and fiscal-year
prefixes that share the same short letter-and-digit shape; PRODUCT_TERMS
excludes the handful of multi-word product-feature names that legitimately
contain one of the process words as a substring. See each constant's own
comment for the exact reasoning.

Rule 3's source half is a ratchet: see RECORD_ID_PATTERN's own comment for
why the record-id shape cannot be told apart from a genuine business
reference number by shape alone in every case, and unrendered_model_fields
elsewhere in this codebase's verification suite for the same kind of
heuristic ratchet used for the same reason. Rule 3's commit-message half is
zero-tolerance over the range under review, not full history -- see
verify.py's `gate_public_repo_hygiene_commit_messages` for why a full-
history count cannot be a stable measurement.

Per-line escape hatch for rule 2 and rule 3's source half: `hygiene-ok:
<reason>` anywhere on the line, for a reference that is itself the point
(this file's own comments, or a test asserting the pattern is absent).
Rule 3's commit-message half checks the same marker per physical line of
the message; an attribution-trailer line is never excused by it.

Proven-against: a docs/buckets/ directory tracked in a synthetic tree, and
a tracked file containing the literal string "docs/buckets/" -- both
observed red, then green once removed. Rule 3: a tracked file containing a
record-id-shaped token and a file containing a process word -- both
observed red, then green once removed or marked hygiene-ok; a commit
message containing a process word observed red in a synthetic git
repository, then green once amended; every shape in
tests/test_gates_actually_fail.py's parametrised false-negative and
false-positive tables, each observed to match its expected outcome.

# Restricting the leading letter to this four-letter set, rather than any
# one or two capital letters, is what lets this codebase's own short
# reference-number families (readiness findings, requirement and derived-fact
# ids, standards prefixes) pass clean without naming each one: none of them
# start with D, T, Q or F immediately followed by a digit or a dash. See

# numbers, also never reaches this check -- its digit run after "F" is never
# followed directly by a dash, so RECORD_ID_PATTERN never matches it at
# all). app/utils/reference_numbers.py supplies "AD-" at its one call site
# as a runtime value, not a constant, and has no list of the others;

# it would pull in Flask configuration and the database extensions for one
