"""Find Jinja macro calls passing a keyword the macro does not accept.

Jinja does not resolve a macro's signature until the call executes, so a
misspelled or borrowed keyword is invisible to every static check the repo
already runs. `template-syntax` parses the file and passes; `boot-health`
resolves url_for and passes; the page then raises

    TypeError: macro 'empty_state' takes no keyword argument 'cta_label'

the first time a real request renders that branch.

The defect this gate was written for, found by a live browser audit of every
route (Aug 2026): `capability_maturity/heatmap.html` imported `empty_state`
from `components/empty_state.html`, whose CTA parameter is `cta_text`, and
called it with `cta_label=`. `cta_label` is not a typo -- it is the correct
parameter name of a *different, identically named* `empty_state` macro in
`macros/page_shell.html`. Two macros share a name across two files, so the
call reads as correct to anyone who has seen the other one, and code review
cannot tell them apart without opening both.

What made it survive to production is the branch it sits in: the empty state
renders only for an organisation with **zero** capabilities. Every seeded
database, every developer machine and every demo tenant has capabilities, so
the crash was reachable only by a brand-new customer -- the worst possible
audience for a 500. That is the argument for a gate rather than a one-line
fix: the class is undetectable by running the app, because the crashing branch
is the one nobody's data reaches.

What is checked
---------------
For every template, each `{% from 'x.html' import macro_name %}` (aliases via
`as` included) is resolved against the macro signatures actually defined in
`x.html`, and every call site's **top-level** keyword arguments are compared
against that signature. Only imported macros are checked: a macro reached
through `{% import 'x.html' as m %}` or inherited from a parent template
cannot be resolved to one definition with confidence, and a gate that guesses
is worse than no gate.

Two rules keep the scan honest rather than approximately right, and both
replace what would otherwise be a filename allowlist:

* **Nesting is respected.** `page_header(title='x', actions=[{'href':
  url_for('v', capability_id=c.id)}])` passes `title` and `actions` -- not
  `capability_id`. Splitting on commas by regex reports every nested
  `url_for` kwarg as an unknown parameter; on this tree that is ~90 false
  positives, which is a gate nobody can act on.
* **Comments are not call sites.** A `{# USAGE: {{ label(for=name,
  text=placeholder) }} #}` block documents a macro; it never executes, and its
  arguments are routinely illustrative rather than real. Jinja comments are
  stripped before scanning, so commented-out code cannot fail the gate and
  no file needs excusing by name.

A macro whose body references `kwargs` accepts arbitrary keywords (Jinja's
implicit `**kwargs` capture) and is skipped.

Escape hatch: append ``macro-kwargs-ok: <reason>`` on the flagged line or the
line above it.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_macro_kwargs.py            # list findings
    python scripts/check_macro_kwargs.py --count    # trailing line = count
    python scripts/check_macro_kwargs.py --root DIR # scan another tree
