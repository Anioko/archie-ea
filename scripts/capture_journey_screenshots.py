"""Capture Architecture Journey screenshots without pytest in the way.

The smoke suite cannot start Playwright's sync API here: some plugin in the test
environment already owns an asyncio loop, and `sync_playwright()` refuses to run
inside one. Disabling pytest-asyncio and anyio did not clear it. Rather than keep
guessing at plugin flags, this drives the browser directly -- no pytest, no
plugins, no loop.

It boots a real server against a real database and photographs what a real user
sees. If the page does not render, it says so and exits non-zero rather than
saving a picture of an error page and calling it evidence.
