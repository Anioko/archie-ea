"""A module-level cache over tenant data must be keyed by the tenant.

Two of these were found on 30 Aug 2026, and both were cross-tenant data leaks
rather than caching quirks. In each case the underlying query was correctly
tenant-scoped and the cache in front of it threw that scoping away.

    capability_health_service._health_metrics_cache
        A single module-level tuple shared by the whole process, holding
        health_by_capability -- every capability's name, id, domain and score.
        For 60 seconds after ANY tenant loaded the capability health dashboard,
        EVERY other tenant was served that tenant's capability names and scores.

    multi_domain_chat_service._RAG_CONTEXT_CACHE
        Keyed by business domain alone, holding architecture principles, PRIOR
        ARB DECISION TITLES and reference architectures -- and injected into the
        AI system prompt, so one tenant's governance history reached another
        tenant's assistant to answer from and cite.

Neither required any action by the receiving user. Nothing detected either: the
`tenant-scoping` and `raw-sql-tenancy` gates read QUERIES, and these are
dictionaries. `do_orm_execute` cannot help, because a cache hit emits no SQL for
it to filter -- the same blind spot CLAUDE.md records for `Query.get()` on an
identity-map hit.

The rule: a module-level mutable mapping in a module that also talks about
tenants must be written with a key that includes the organisation. A dict keyed
by anything else -- a domain, a name, nothing at all -- is shared by every
tenant in the process.

Detection: find module-level dict assignments whose name looks like a cache, in
a module that references current_org_id or organization_id, and check every
write to that name (``NAME[...] = ...``) for an organisation term in the
subscript. A cache written only via a variable is checked for that variable
being derived from the tenant in the same function.

Escape hatch: `cache-tenancy-ok: <reason>` on the declaration, for a cache whose
contents are genuinely global (a framework registry, an enum lookup, a parsed
config). Say WHY the contents are tenant-independent -- "it's only small" is not
a reason, and neither leak was large.

    python scripts/check_cache_tenancy.py
    python scripts/check_cache_tenancy.py --count

Proven-against: `_health_metrics_cache[tenant]` changed back to a shared
constant key -- red naming that module, green when the tenant key was restored.
