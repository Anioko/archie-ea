"""Find form controls a screen reader cannot name.

An `<input>`, `<select>` or `<textarea>` with no label is announced as its type
and nothing else -- "combo box", "edit text" -- so the only way to learn what a
field holds is to fill it in and see what breaks. A live browser audit of every
route as a signed-in user (Aug 2026) found 34 of them: every filter select in
the toolbars on /architecture/elements and /applications/rationalization/workbench,
the "Paste CSV Data" textarea on /batch-import/new (which *had* a visible
`<label>` -- it just had no `for`, so the association was never made), and the
"select all" checkbox in six different table headers, where a keyboard user has
no way to know the box selects the whole page of rows.

A `placeholder` is not a label. It is not exposed as an accessible name by every
combination of browser and screen reader, and it disappears the moment the user
types -- so the one person who most needs the field described loses the
description first.

What counts as a label
----------------------
``aria-label``, ``title``, ``aria-labelledby``, a ``<label for=...>`` naming the
control's id, being wrapped in a ``<label>`` that carries text, and a name
supplied at runtime by Alpine (``:aria-label`` / ``x-text`` on an associated
label). The runtime case is a genuine pass, not an allowlist: an ``:aria-label``
that interpolates the row's name is a better label than any static string, and a
checker that did not understand the rule would push authors to add a *worse*
hardcoded one just to go green.

Out of scope: ``type="hidden"``, and ``type="submit"``/``"button"``/``"reset"``,
whose name comes from ``value`` -- covered by scripts/check_control_labels.py.

Escape hatch: append ``input-label-ok: <reason>`` on the flagged line or the
line above it.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_input_labels.py            # list findings
    python scripts/check_input_labels.py --count    # trailing line = count
    python scripts/check_input_labels.py --root DIR # scan another tree
